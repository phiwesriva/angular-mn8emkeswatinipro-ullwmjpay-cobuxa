<h2>CONSIDER RE-ADJUSTING YOUR MONTHLY BANK LOAN REPAYMENT</h2>

<p>Following the Central Bank of Eswatini's (CBE) decision to cut the Interest Rate by 2% over the past two months, commercial banks have also dropped their Prime Lending Rate, it currently stands at 8% per annum.</p>

<p>This means if you have a loan with one of the banks in the country your loan repayment has gone down. You can either continue to pay the same amount you paid before the rate cut by the CBE to finish paying earlier, or if you in a financial fix you can contact your bank to re-adjust your loan repayment as some banks do not automatically effect a change in your monthly loan repayment after a Repo Rate discount.</p>

<p>However, we must stress that only contact your bank if necessary. This is just one of the measures that can be utilized instead of taking another loan or payment holiday.
